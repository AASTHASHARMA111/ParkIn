SMART SOLUTION FOR PARKING  MANAGEMENT

Urban cities face growing challenges in managing parking spaces, leading to congestion, pollution, and wasted time for drivers. Antineutrino is a smart parking management system designed to optimize parking availability, guide drivers to free spaces in real time, and improve overall urban traffic flow.

The system integrates IoT sensors, machine learning, and mapping tools to predict parking demand, offer dynamic pricing, and provide a user-friendly mobile interface for drivers. City administrators benefit from dashboards displaying occupancy trends, traffic hotspots, and revenue optimization insights.

Key advantages include reduced vehicle search time, lower carbon emissions, increased city revenue, and enhanced safety by minimizing illegal parking. Antineutrino leverages modern technologies like React.js, Python (Flask/FastAPI), MongoDB, Mapbox, Firebase, and Google Cloud, ensuring scalability, security, and efficient data management.

By combining AI-driven predictive analytics with real-time monitoring, the project offers a technologically advanced, economically viable, and socially impactful solution to urban parking problems. Antineutrino exemplifies how smart technologies can make cities more efficient, sustainable, and driver-friendly.
